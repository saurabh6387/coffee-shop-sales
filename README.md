ðŸŒŸ **Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Using Excel** ðŸŒŸ

I'm excited to share my latest project where I analyzed retail sales data from a coffee shop to uncover actionable insights aimed at improving business performance. This analysis helped answer several important questions, including:

1. **How do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day?** 
2. **Are there any peak times for sales activity?**
3. **What is the total sales revenue for each month?**
4. **How do sales vary across different store locations?**
5. **What is the average price per order per person?**
6. **Which products are the best-selling in terms of quantity and revenue?**
7. **How do sales vary by product category and type?**
